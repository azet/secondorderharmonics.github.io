## Second Order Harmonics: the kind of Distortion our ears apprechiate

[Harmonics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harmonic) are waves of frequencies that are multiples of a so-called <<fundamental>> (i.e. original-- or base) frequency. They are part of music theory and electrical engineering alike; in audio engineering & design there's a common term used to benchmark Distortion in a product, part or audio-chain called [THD](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Total_harmonic_distortion) ([Total Harmonic Distortion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Total_harmonic_distortion) traditionally written *THD+N*--where *N* stands for *Noise*, as in past times measurement was less accurate and you would include Total Harmonic Distortion and Noise into one metric for ease of measurement.) This practice continues today in audio product specifications, benchmarks and common industry standards --- you'll find these values written out in the details or specs. of products like ADC- & DAC converters, audio interfaces or pre-amplifiers.

> Second-order or ‘even’ harmonics are even-numbered multiples of the fundamental
> frequencies and create a rich, pleasing sound. Third-order or ‘odd’ harmonics are 
> odd-numbered multiples of the fundamental frequencies, which give the signal an 
> edgier, more aggressive sound.
