title: More Content coming Soon
description: "as well as a optimized mobile version"
---

At the moment some pictures and sites don't render optimally on mobile platforms like smartphone browsers. We're working on fixing this. We thought we should finally get the website online instead of moving the release date further back, so we have some info online right away. Most of the important information and contact details, shop etc. is already on the site. 

#### Whats to come
We'll add more content on analog audio gear, recording, tracking, mixing and mastering techniques in the analog domain as well as with hybrid set-ups. Extend the About Us section regarding the background of our namesake. We'll also add a rental list and agreement and more information on custom pieces we've designed from the ground up or modified for customers.

Hope to see you back here soon!
