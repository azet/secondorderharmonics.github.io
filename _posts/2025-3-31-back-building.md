title: We're building and customizing again!
description: "and fixed our mail issues"

It's 2025 already! And we're back!

Due to other work we had very little time to sell customized gear, and got less inquiries than expected, some potential customers went on for hours about potential needed features, but rarely this had the outcome of an actual order. We're building high quality kits from link audio, JLM, CAPI and AML again. Modding / extending them as requested. As always: info@secondorderharmonics.eu is the primary contact point (now also routes correctly to our small team - you should get regular updates and fast replies - if you're unsure, just drop us another line via mail!). 

To keep long conversations that do not end in any actual orders shorter and to give more time to real customers, we will from now on happily discuss new ideas of e.g. custom summing mixers with different input options, specific OpAmps, transformers etc. - but can't have e-mail threads that go on for weeks without an actual order. As such: from now on we're going to charge for desgin and implementation work as soon as we see that more than a regular amount of email correspondence went into a discussion with a potential customer. We'll of course let all potential customers know up front in time, and give you the option if you want us to work on your product, just chosse something off-the-line or we'd happily refer to other excellent audio and DIY shops that may even have the perfect product you're looking for (as we always have!) instead. We hope you understand and are as happy as we are for cool upcoming additions!

We want to thank in particular: JLM and Link Audio as well as DIYRE for support and being there for our questions in the past on our way. As well as personal friends specializing in EE and audio PCB design - you know who you are :)
