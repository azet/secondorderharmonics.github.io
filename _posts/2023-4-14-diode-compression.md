title: Did you know? Using diodes for audio signal compression
---
Ever wondered how diodes can be used to compress audio signals like in the famous old studio consoles by Neve or outboard units old and new? Unfortunately good articles on the topic are few and far around. One that's worth reading concerning compressors using diode bridge rectifiers can be found here (it's full of Ads unfortunately): [https://www.whippedcreamsounds.com/diode-bridge-compressor/](https://www.whippedcreamsounds.com/diode-bridge-compressor/)


A much better article on VCAs in general also describes the use of diodes and vari-mu tubes among all other common designs using components from LDRs (opto) to ICs (what most people in the professional audio and studio world call "VCA" compressors collectively) and describes why and how other compressors use these components to achieve compression and limiting, design drawbacks and common distortion reasons as well as the necessary technical background and examples: [https://sound-au.com/articles/vca-techniques.html](https://sound-au.com/articles/vca-techniques.html) *(website highly recommended for audio enthusiasts)*
