title: "Update: Sontec MEP250 500 Unit"
---

Formerly known as the "Don Classics Sontec MEP250" is now available again [under new ownership by Quantum J Audio](https://quantumjaudio.com/). As such we're adding *it on request* to our catalouge of available hardware - built & customized to order.

This great unit/kit has been out of stock and changed owners recently and as such, we haven’t been able to acquire any of the required hardware or kits in the past – as this has changed now we will be offering on request 500 units the replicas of the famous sontec — please get in contact if you’re interested, we are also offering modifications custom opamps and front panels. For modifications might be possible they will be on time and material basis - just let us know what you have in mind. A few ideas:


* API-format OpAmps like the [red dot](https://www.resistanceaudio.com/products/reddot-discrete-opamp), cheaper but equally excellent sounding [link audio replicas](https://www.linkaudiodesign.de/product-page/lx2520) and many more can all be added on request.

* The PCB supports easily swapping chip-package opamps as well - as they all come in sockets, if you have a specific one in mind, let us check if we could acommodate you and the design of the board. Even without electronic skills, these are easy to swap for users, as are finished [API-format OpAmps](assets/images/posts/API_2520.jpeg):

* There are many Sontec EQ [modifications from JLM audio](https://www.jlmaudio.com/shop/sontec-spare-parts.html?display_tax_prices=1) out of AUS. 

* In addition there are of course a multitude of discrete and op-amp kits that can be used and switched for the ones that come with the default config. We can recommend something based of very old-school op-amps as well as new replicas and replacements, other component mods may color sound a bit more. We just need to know what you're looking for specifically.

**Please be aware that wait time is around 6 Weeks** due to having to source parts indidually, with customizations and mods possibily having a longer lead time, and *we're not stocking units as requests for them have been low in the past*. But we think this nice unit has been gone widely underapprechiated and unrecognized and are happy it's back. We hope you're too!
