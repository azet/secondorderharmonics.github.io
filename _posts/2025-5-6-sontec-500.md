title: SONTEC MEP250 500 Stereo Update
description: "available with modifications on request now!"
---


This great unit/kit has been out of stock and changed owners recently and as such, we haven’t been able to acquire any of the required hardware or kits in the past – as this has changed now we will be offering on request 500 units the replicas of the famous sontec — please get in contact if you’re interested, we are also offering modifications custom opamps and front panels. For modifications might be possible they will be on time and material basis - just let us know what you have in mind.

There's a multitude of discrete and op-amp kits that can be used and switched for the ones that come with the default config. We can recommend something based of very-old school op-amps, others that color sound a bit more and much more, just get in contact.

Wait time is around 6 Weeks due to having to source parts indidually and we're currently not stocking units as requests for them have been low (we think this nice unit has been gone widely underapprechiated and unrecognized and are happy it's back). API-format OpAmps like the red dot, link audio replicas etc. can all be added, as could be some [modifications from JLM audio](https://www.jlmaudio.com/shop/sontec-spare-parts.html?display_tax_prices=1) out of AUS.
