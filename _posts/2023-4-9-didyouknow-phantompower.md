title: "Did you know? 48V/Phantom Power & it's history"
---


	In 1966, Neumann GmbH presented a new type of transistorized microphone to the Norwegian 
	Broadcasting Corporation, NRK. Norwegian Radio had requested phantom-powered operation.
    Since NRK already had 48-volt power available in their studios for their emergency lighting
    systems, this voltage was used for powering the new microphones (model KM 84), and is the 
    origin of 48-volt phantom power. This arrangement was later standardized in DIN 45596.
