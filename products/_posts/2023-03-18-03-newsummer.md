We've received the first batch of prototypes of our active Summing mixer version: Tascam/DSUB25 to XLR/TRS combo Jack. "E-OpAmp-Z Summer" (PCB v1.1A). It uses a Texas Instruments NE5532ADR dual low noise opamp.

We also ordered two 3D printed PC-ABS cases for testing. They're still in production, to be shipped soon for evaluation.
