We have another item for made-to-order sales: the CAPI VP312DI-VPR-Litz[^vp312di], two different DI configuration options. A very faithful replica of the API 312 mic pre with additional active or passive (you choose) Direct Inject (DI) HiZ Jack that has the same path as the mic input; so you get the option to use the Pad on the DI as well. The preamp comes with Greyhill Stepped Gain control Knob for easy recall, only using high grade audiophile components and a specially designed Litz wire 2503 Output Transformer[^litzwire].

Optional mods and custom OpAmps also possible on request.
