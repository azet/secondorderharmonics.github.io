Today we received our order of colour modules for saturation, coloration and compression for mods to pre amps. 

We're now able to offer 1176 style 1:4 or brick wall compression [^0] via a blend knob in API 312 pre amp clones from link audio design [^1]. these high quality pre amps also feature variable high & low pass filters, phantom power, Pad and a very useful addition of a fader for the channel independent of the gain knob among other neat updates to the original design well suited for modern recording studio setups and project studio work whether hybrid or purely analog. You can also choose custom OpAmps from original vintage API 2520s and high quality replicas like the CAPI CA-0252 [^2] thereof from various vendors to the famous red dot opamp [^3]. A perfect proven combination for tracking/recording and mixing drums, acoustic instruments and vocals for rock, punk, metal, electronica,.....

In addition we can offer mods from tape saturation to tube coloration, Neve-style transformer sound for a big and warm low end added to the mid-forward punch that API pre amps are famous for and made history recording most of the classic rock records during the 70ies and from there on. Many more  options and mods on request.
