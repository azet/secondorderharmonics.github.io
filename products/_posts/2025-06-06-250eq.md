Formerly known as the "Don Classics Sontec MEP250 [^0] clone" is now available again [under new ownership [^1] by Quantum J Audio](https://quantumjaudio.com/). As such we're adding it <ins>on request</ins> to our catalouge of available hardware - built & customized to order.

#### Description from the vendor:
> A 500 series kit based on the fully parametric EQ of the classic MEP-250A

- Full Kit comes with high quality components and hardware for build
- Easily remove op amps for rail testing and trouble shooting with 13 x IC sockets
- Colour coded hardware test points to clip DMM leads in setup
- Board mounted pots with one ribbon cable connection for ease and speed of assembly
- Dual concentric pots allow space on front panel for ergonomics
- Centre notched cut/boost pots, easily zeroed if band not required.
- Can run on standard 500 series 16v or 51X 24v
- Standard kit comes with IC’s, can use discrete op amps.
- Authentic recreation of original circuit

- The only 500 series that is completely faithful to the MEP-250A original design
- 5 fully parametric bands with custom made dual concentric pots.
- ±12db of boost and cuts (boost and cut can be altered with a resistor change per band)
- 15 Hz – 25 kHz frequency range
- Polystyrene capacitors on EQ bands
- 2 x op amps in servo circuit per filter with trim pot for precise elimination of DC offset
- Available assembled or as a full kit

#### Our take:

This great unit/kit has been out of stock and changed owners recently and as such, we haven’t been able to acquire any of the required hardware or kits in the past – as this has changed now we will be offering on request 500 units the replicas of the famous sontec — please get in contact if you’re interested, we are also offering modifications custom opamps and front panels. Modifications are  possible - design/integration and development (if necessary at all) will be on a time and material basis - just let us know what you have in mind. Or which sound you're looking for. A few ideas:


* API-format OpAmps like the [red dot](https://www.resistanceaudio.com/products/reddot-discrete-opamp), cheaper but equally excellent sounding [link audio replicas](https://www.linkaudiodesign.de/product-page/lx2520) and many more can all be added on request.

* The PCB supports easily swapping chip-package opamps as well - as they all come in sockets, if you have a specific one in mind, let us check if we could acommodate you and the design of the board. Even without electronic skills, these are easy to swap for users, as are finished [API-format OpAmps](assets/images/posts/API_2520.jpeg):

* There are many Sontec EQ [modifications from JLM audio](https://www.jlmaudio.com/shop/sontec-spare-parts.html?display_tax_prices=1) out of AUS. 

* In addition there are of course a multitude of discrete and op-amp kits that can be used and switched for the ones that come with the default config. We can recommend something based of very old-school op-amps as well as new replicas and replacements, other component mods may color sound a bit more. We just need to know what you're looking for specifically.

**Please be aware that wait time is around 6 Weeks** due to having to source parts indidually, with customizations and mods possibily having a longer lead time, and *we're not stocking units as requests for them have been low in the past*. But we think this nice unit has been gone widely underapprechiated and unrecognized and are happy it's back. We hope you're too!
