It's the reason behind a big market for analog summing devices, high-end analog-to-digital converters, analog outboard gear as well as hybrid set-up techniques where mix engineers and producers work In-The-Box but -- at the same time -- process specific mix channels, entire [Stems](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stem_(audio)) or simple sounds through analog equipment -- back into a final digital bounce to disk inside a computer for ease of editing, distribution & storage.
