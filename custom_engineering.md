			<h2>Made to Measure &mdash; From tracking to mastering</h2>
		</header>
		<p>We build the finest pre amplifiers, equalizers and compressors in 500 Series format or as outboard gear. You choose the kind of OpAmp or Transformers you want, special settings, frequencies you'd like to be able to select. Mods for coloration, saturation, compression in units that would usually not offer features like that. We're also happy to mod existing outboard gear to your needs.</p>
		<p>From tracking to mixing and mastering &mdash; we build, sell and offer design work only using the finest parts and brands in pro-audio. Please get in touch below if you have any questions or projects in mind.</p>
